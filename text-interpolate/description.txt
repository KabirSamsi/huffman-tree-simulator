Welcome to Lab 3 - Reversing Text!
This program first opens a text file of your choice. It then proceeds to open this file, which is either a poem or a paragraph-long prose statement.
It first evaluates whether or not an excerpt is in prose or poem format based on its length.
It implements the stack and queue data structures to evaluate whether text is inverted, and accordingly prints it out.
The resultant data is then written to a text file.
