Welcome to CS124 Lab 1 (Speech Analysis Program). This program aims to analyze three different speeches from two genres.
Two of the speeches are politically aligned - US President Joe Biden's victory speech (2021) and New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Arden's COVID-19 Address (2020).
The third speech is a commencement speech - Steve Jobs' Stanford Commencement Address (2005).
All three speeches are opened and read from one text file. Each word is standardized (converted to lowercase and removed of punctuation) and stored in a vector.
This vector is then sorted alphabetically, utilizing three quadratic-time sorting algorithms - Selection Sort, Bubblesort and Insertion Sort.
Each algorithm is timed using the Chrono High-Res Clock, and compared (on both sorted and unsorted vectors) and the algorithm running time is outputted to the screen.
Following the sort, the last 50 words of the vector, and the first 50 unique words, are printed out to the screen.
The most frequent words in the vector are then outputted in order of frequency (with fillers and short words removed).
