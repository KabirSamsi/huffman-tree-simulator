Welcome to CS124 Lab 2 (Sort and Search Averages). This program aims to perform and analyze the sorting of three different works of literature, and compare average times.
One text sample is around 5000 words long ("The Necklace" by Guy de Maupessant and "Gift of the Magi" by O. Henry).
One text sample is around 10000 words long (the first 3 chapters of "The Pearl" by John Steinbeck).
One text sample is around 20000 words long (the first 13 chapters of "The Da Vinci Code" by Dan Brown).
The user prompts the algorithm to open two text files. Those two are both opened and read. Each word has excess punctuation (except for apostrophes and hyphens) and stored in a vector.
This vector is then sorted alphabetically twenty-five times in total - using the five main sorting algorithms, and timing each one five times.
Each algorithm is timed using the Chrono High-Res Clock, and its average time is calculated over five iterations. This is then outputted to the screen.
Following the sorts, the last 50 words of the vector are printed out to the screen.
The user is then prompted to search for a word in the vector. The quicksort-sorted vector is selected, and the word is searched for (case-insensitive) using Linear Search (unsorted), Linear Search (sorted) and Binary Search.
These are timed and outputted to the screen as well.
The user is then prompted to repeat the algorithm, or can exit.
